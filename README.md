Due to the growing number of automobiles, congestion has become a bizarre problem in modern living which results in mishaps. After everything that has been done to improve transport infrastructure in the city thus far, there are still areas that are vulnerable to the dangers that lurk around every corner. The problem necessitates an efficient study to significantly lower the frightening results (Helen et al., 2018). This is also supported by the ILO's statement: "Fatalities are not fated; accidents do not just happen; illness does not just occur; they are caused" (ILO 2003). Accidents are caused by unsafe conditions, unsafe acts, or both. Accidents have multiple contributing factors. Accident causation can be explained by a variety of theories in the literature. According to Khanzode et al. (2012), accident proneness theory is one theory behind the accidents.
Using machine learning to predict road accidents could be a valuable tool for improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents on the roads. There are several factors that can contribute to road accidents, such as weather conditions, road conditions, the behavior of drivers and pedestrians, and the type of vehicles involved. A machine learning model could be trained on data containing information on these factors to make predictions about the likelihood of an accident occurring in a particular location or under certain circumstances. To develop an effective model, it would be important to gather a large and diverse dataset that includes information about various types of accidents and carefully tune the model using techniques such as cross-validation.

The purpose of this research is to use machine learning to predict the severity of accidents and therefore create an application which will assist in locating accident-prone regions in relation to different accident-factors as well as in figuring out the connection between these indicators and deaths.
